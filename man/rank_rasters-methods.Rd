\title{Get Zonation result rank rasters of a project.}
\usage{
rank_rasters(x, variants = NULL)

\S4method{rank_rasters}{Zproject}(x, variants = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{Zproject}} object.}

\item{variants}{a numeric (IDs) or character (name) vector defining which
variants are included in the returned stack (default: NULL means all).}
}
\value{
\code{\link[raster:RasterStack-class]{RasterStack}} object. If no
  rank rasters are available at all, return NA.
}
\description{
Each \code{\link{Zproject}} object has a set of variants and their results
associated with it. This method will get the selected available rank rasters
(1 per variant) and create a \code{\link[raster:RasterStack-class]{RasterStack}}
object.
}
\details{
Argument \code{variants} can be used to the define which variants are
included, the default is to return all. Method will give a warning if a
variant doesn't have a rank raster associated with it. If none of the
variants have a rank raster, then a NA is returned.
