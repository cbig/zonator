# zonator

`zonator` is a utility R package for dealing with various tasks related to
Zonation conservation prioritization software. The package started out as a collection
of helper scripts which have now been packaged for anybody interested in using
a familiar tool (R) in setting up Zonation runs and managing Zonation results.

Functions and classes found in `zonator` can be useful for the following stages
of running a Zonation analysis.

1. Setting up a Zonation project and pre-processing files ([examples](https://cbig.github.io/zonator/articles/zonator-project.html)).
1. Running Zonation.
